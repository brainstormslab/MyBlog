## Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, You will also need to have Apache installed in order to work through these steps. If you haven’t already done so, you can get Apache installed on your server through apt-get:
```jsx
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2
```
After these steps are complete, we can get started.

For the purposes of this guide, our configuration will make a virtual host for example.com and another for test.com. These will be referenced throughout the guide, but you should substitute your own domains or values while following along.

## First Step - Create Directory Structure
Our document root (the top-level directory that Apache looks at to find content to serve) will be set to individual directories under the `/var/www` directory. We will create a directory here for both of the virtual hosts we plan on making.

Within each of these directories, we will create a `public_html` folder that will hold our actual files. This gives us some flexibility in our hosting.

For instance, for our sites, we’re going to make our directories like this:
```jsx
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/`example.com`/public_html
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/`test.com`/public_html
```
The portions in red represent the domain names that we are wanting to serve from our VPS.

## Step Two - Grant Permissions
Now we have the directory structure for our files, but they are owned by our root user. If we want our regular user to be able to modify files in our web directories, we can change the ownership by doing this:
```jsx
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/public_html
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/test.com/public_html
```
The `$USER` variable will take the value of the user you are currently logged in as when you press Enter. By doing this, our regular user now owns the `public_html` subdirectories where we will be storing our content.

We should also modify our permissions a little bit to ensure that read access is permitted to the general web directory and all of the files and folders it contains so that pages can be served correctly:
```jsx
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
```
Your web server should now have the permissions it needs to serve content, and your user should be able to create content within the necessary folders.

## Step Three - Create Demo Pages for Each Virtual host
We’re just going for a demonstration, so our pages will be very simple. We’re just going to make an index.html page for each site.

Let’s start with `example.com`. We can open up an `index.html` file in our editor by typing:
```jsx
nano /var/www/example.com/public_html/index.html
```
In this file, create a simple HTML document that indicates the site it is connected to. My file looks like this:
```jsx
/var/www/example.com/public_html/index.html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Welcome to Example.com!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Success!  The example.com virtual host is working!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
Save and close the file when you are finished.

We can copy this file to use as the basis for our second site by typing:
```jsx
cp /var/www/example.com/public_html/index.html /var/www/test.com/public_html/index.html
```
We can then open the file and modify the relevant pieces of information:
```jsx
nano /var/www/test.com/public_html/index.html
/var/www/test.com/public_html/index.html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Welcome to Test.com!</title>
  </head>
  <body> <h1>Success!  The test.com virtual host is working!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
Save and close this file as well. You now have the pages necessary to test the virtual host configuration.

## Step Four - Create New Virual Host files

** Create the First Virtual Host File **
Start by copying the file for the first domain:
```jsx
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf
```
Open the new file in your editor with root privileges:
```jsx
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf
```
The file will look something like this (I’ve removed the comments here to make the file more approachable):
```jsx
/etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
As you can see, there’s not much here. We will customize the items here for our first domain and add some additional directives. This virtual host section matches any requests that are made on port 80, the default HTTP port.

First, we need to change the ServerAdmin directive to an email that the site administrator can receive emails through.

ServerAdmin admin@example.com
After this, we need to add two directives. The first, called ServerName, establishes the base domain that should match for this virtual host definition. This will most likely be your domain. The second, called ServerAlias, defines further names that should match as if they were the base name. This is useful for matching hosts you defined, like www:
```jsx
ServerName example.com
ServerAlias www.example.com
```
The only other thing we need to change for a basic virtual host file is the location of the document root for this domain. We already created the directory we need, so we just need to alter the DocumentRoot directive to reflect the directory we created:

`DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/public_html`
In total, our virtualhost file should look like this:
```jsx
/etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@example.com
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAlias www.example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/public_html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Save and close the file.

** Copy First Virtual Host and Customize for Second Domain **
Now that we have our first virtual host file established, we can create our second one by copying that file and adjusting it as needed.

Start by copying it:
```jsx
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/test.com.conf
```
Open the new file with root privileges in your editor:
```jsx
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/test.com.conf
```
You now need to modify all of the pieces of information to reference your second domain. When you are finished, it may look something like this:
```jsx
/etc/apache2/sites-available/test.com.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@test.com
    ServerName test.com
    ServerAlias www.test.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/test.com/public_html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Save and close the file when you are finished.

** Step Five - Enable the New Virtual Host Files **

We can use the a2ensite tool to enable each of our sites like this:
```jsx
sudo a2ensite example.com.conf
sudo a2ensite test.com.conf
```
Next, disable the default site defined in `000-default.conf`:
```jsx
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
```
When you are finished, you need to restart Apache to make these changes take effect:
```jsx
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
In other documentation, you may also see an example using the service command:
```jsx
sudo service apache2 restart
```
`You need to add both sites to the a2ensite to work if you only add one the other should not be include when you run the restart`

** Step Six - Set Up Local Hosts **

This will intercept any requests for the domains that you configured and point them to your VPS server, just as the DNS system would do if you were using registered domains. This will only work from your computer though, and is simply useful for testing purposes.

Make sure you are operating on your local computer for these steps and not your VPS server. You will need to know the computer’s administrative password or otherwise be a member of the administrative group.

If you are on a Mac or Linux computer, edit your local file with administrative privileges by typing:
```jsx
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
If you are on a Windows machine, you can find instructions on altering your hosts file here.

The details that you need to add are the public IP address of your VPS server followed by the domain you want to use to reach that VPS.

For the domains that I used in this guide, assuming that my VPS IP address is `111.111.111.111`, I could add the following lines to the bottom of my hosts file:
```jsx
/etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.1.1   guest-desktop
111.111.111.111 example.com
111.111.111.111 test.com
```
This will direct any requests for `example.com` and `test.com` on our computer and send them to our server at `111.111.111.111`. This is what we want if we are not actually the owners of these domains in order to test our virtual hosts.

Save and close the file.

`This if you didnt read is saying that the domain need to be registered so when is been looked outside of the server the computer look at the local server in this case apache and show the virtual host that you create for that domain.`

I take this information from [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04) but i remove some section that i feel are not need.
