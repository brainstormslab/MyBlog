A qualified full stack developer should have functional knowledge and capabilities for all aspects involved in building the application.

1) Programming languages
You need to be proficient in multiple programming languages, such as JAVA, PHP, C #, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. As most of your core business processes need to be written in these languages.Maybe not all need. But you also have to master the language grammar, and to be very familiar with how to structure, design, implementation, and testing of the project based on one language or more languages. For example, if you choose JAVA, then you need to master the object-oriented design and development, design patterns, J2EE-based components of the development and so on.

Where to learn: Git/GitHub — You have to know how to use Git to manage and share your code.


2) Use development frameworks and third-party libraries
The popular development languages are generally accompanied by a good development framework, such as JAVA Spring, MyBatis, Hibernate, Python Django, PHP thinkphp, yin, nodeJs express and so on.

3) Front-end technology
Front-end technologies are becoming more and more important in today’s project and product development. In addition to product features, the user experience is also one of the criteria to test the success of a product. All that depends on the implementation of the front-end technology, soyou need to master some basic front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and further study the front-end frameworks or third-party libraries such as JQuery, LESS, SASS, AngularJS, or REACT.

Where to learn: You don’t know JS

4) Database and cache
Any product or project needs a database to store data. As a full stack developer, you also need to have at least one or two databases and know how to interact with the database. Currently, the popular database is MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Oracle, SQLServer and so on. As a document-type database, MongoDB, is being used more widely in Internet products. As for larger projects, Ialso recommend using MySQL or commercial Oracle as the back-end database. While memory databases, such as Redis, can be used for caching to improve system performance.

5) Basic design ability
Most of the articles or discussions about the full stack developer are rarely related to the design requirements. But I think the design skill is very important, the principle and skill of basic prototype design, UI design, UX design are also needed to understand.

6) Self-requirements are also an essential factor to become a full stack developer:
Global thinking
Good communication skills
Creativity
Curiosity
Time management skills
Wrap Up
According to Gladwell’s 10,000 hours of law, it will spend 10 years to master the front-end, back-end, client-oriented knowledge content to be a full stack developer. Therefore, the full stack developer is by no means to accomplished overnight. What you need to do is laying the technical foundation, strengthen the core skills, and keep learning for more challenges.
